 # December just got hotter!!!
 After a crazy run of global shows and back-to-back hits Asake is coming home to Africa this December! and the line up is already looking like a premium detty December! This is a real gist spilled by asake himself at t his last show in Los Angeles

 ## Lagos; Asake Live at Bay Water Park
Lagos is about to give take back what it owed. Asake will be performing live at Bay Water Park in Lekki on <strong>Saturday, 20 December 2025</strong>. 
Bay Water Park is already known for vibe, but with Asake on the lineup it is going to feel like music movie where everybody will be shouting lyrics word-for-word.

Expect:

- Live performance of the big bangers; Mr Money, Peace Be Unto You, Lonely At The Top, MMS and more  
- That trademark *choir-style backup* and *fuji-infused vocals* that turn every chorus into an anthem  
- Dancers, lights, and the kind of energy that makes you forget you’ve been standing for hours

If you’re in Lagos for December and you miss this? That’s not village people that’s you!

##  Accra: Asake at AfroFuture Ghana

On the 28th December 2025 Asake will be performing live at the biggest show in Ghana.
Accra has quietly turned into one of the global capitals of Detty December, and <strong>AfroFuture</strong> is one of the key reasons. This year, Asake is on the bill, bringing his full Afro-fusion, neo-fuji, street-meets-global sound to a festival crowd that already loves him.

This show is not just for Ghanaian fans – it’s a magnet for:

- Nigerians in diaspora flying down for December  
- International Afrobeat lovers who want to experience the culture live  
- Festival lovers who want that mix of fashion, food, art, and loud music

With Asake on stage, expect a high-energy set, live crowd responses, and that feeling of “Afrobeats has fully taken over the world and we’re watching it live.”

##  What Makes These Shows Special?

These aren’t just random dates on a flyer. They’re important for a few reasons:

### 1. *Homecoming Energy*
After touring and dropping projects that chart globally, Asake coming back to African stages in December feels like a proper homecoming. It’s a chance for core fans – the people who have been screaming his lyrics from day one to experience him live without a screen in between.

### 2. *Detty December + Mr Money = Problem*
December in Lagos and Accra is no joke. Beaches, clubs, rooftops, festivals – there’s always something happening. Add Asake to that mix and you’re looking at *one of the standout moments of the whole holiday season*.

### 3. *Street Sound on Big Stages*
Asake’s sound started from the street fuji, chants, Yoruba lyrics, heavy drums, but now it’s living comfortably on global playlists. Seeing that same raw sound presented on big, well-produced stages in Lagos and Accra is proof that *street music didn’t just blow… it evolved.*

##  How to Use This on Your Calendar (And Your Wardrobe)

If you’re thinking of going, here’s the simple breakdown:

- *Pick your city:* Lagos? Accra? Or both if your life is soft.  
- *Sort your tickets early:* December shows sell out fast, especially when Detty December people land.  
- *Plan your fit:* This is not a “just wear anything” concert. You will be on somebody’s Instagram Story. Dress accordingly.
